Behavioral pattern is a design pattern that deals with communication between objects and how they work together to achieve common goals. Behavioral patterns are concerned with the way objects interact with one another, and with how these interactions can be made more flexible and efficient.

The goal of behavioral patterns is to provide a way to organize and manage the behavior of objects in a way that makes them easier to work with, and that allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the codebase. Behavioral patterns can help to solve common problems that arise when working with complex object interactions, such as managing state, coordinating activities between objects, and defining algorithms that can be shared among different objects.
