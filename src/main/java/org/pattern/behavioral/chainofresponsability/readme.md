# Chain of Responsibility

The Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to handle requests in a sequential chain. Each object in the chain has the ability to handle a request or pass it on to the next object in the chain until the request is handled or there are no more objects to handle it.

## The Chain of Responsibility should be used when:
The Chain of Responsibility pattern should be used when there are multiple objects that can handle a request and the handler of the request is not known at compile-time. The pattern allows the request to be handled by the appropriate object in the runtime.The pattern allows for flexibility in handling the request and can provide a fallback mechanism if the primary handler is unable to handle the request.
This pattern is useful when:

- There is more than one object that can handle a request.
- The handler of the request is not known at compile-time.
- A set of processing objects should be used for a request based on runtime conditions.

## Chain of Responsibility pros and cons:

### Pros
- Decouples the sender of the request from its receiver, giving more flexibility in handling the request.
- Allows more than one object to handle a request, providing a fallback mechanism in case the primary handler cannot handle the request.
- Supports adding or removing handlers dynamically without affecting other parts of the system.

### Cons
- May result in an increased response time if the request passes through multiple objects before being handled.
- Can lead to security issues if a malicious object is added to the chain and intercepts the request.
- Can be difficult to debug due to the dynamic nature of the pattern.
