# Structural Patterns

Structural pattern is a design pattern that deals with object composition and relationships. Structural patterns are concerned with the way objects are composed to form larger structures, and with how these structures can be made flexible and efficient.

The goal of structural patterns is to provide a way to organize and manage objects in a way that makes them easier to work with, and that allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the codebase. Structural patterns can help to solve common problems that arise when working with complex object relationships, such as managing hierarchies, composing objects into larger structures, and adapting interfaces to meet changing requirements.
