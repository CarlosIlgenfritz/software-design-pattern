# Facade

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## The facade pattern should be used when:
-  Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.

## Facade pattern pros and cons:

### Pros
- You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.

### Cons
-   A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.
