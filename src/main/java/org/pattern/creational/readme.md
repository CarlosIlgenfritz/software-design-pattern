# Creational Patterns

Creational pattern is a design pattern that deals with object creation mechanisms,
trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. 
Creational patterns are concerned with the process of object creation,
rather than with the structure of objects themselves.

In general, the goal of creational patterns is to provide a way to create objects while hiding the 
creation logic, rather than exposing it directly to the client code. 
This helps to decouple the client code from the object creation process,
and allows for greater flexibility and maintainability in the codebase.
