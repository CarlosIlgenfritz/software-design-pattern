# Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that allows the creation of families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It provides an interface for creating families of objects that are designed to work together and abstracts the process of object creation.

## The Abstract Factory Pattern should be used when:
The Abstract Factory pattern is useful in scenarios where a system should be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. It is helpful when you need to:

- Create families of related objects without coupling the code to their concrete classes.
- Ensure that a system is compatible with multiple families of related objects.
- Provide a way to enforce a consistent interface across all objects in a family.
- Decouple the code from the details of object creation.


##  Abstract Factory Pattern pros and cons:

### Pros
- Provides a way to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Ensures that a system is compatible with multiple families of related objects.
- Provides a way to enforce a consistent interface across all objects in a family.
- Decouples the code from the details of object creation, making it more flexible and easier to maintain.

### Cons
- Can increase the complexity of the code, as it introduces additional layers of abstraction.
- Can result in a large number of classes, especially when dealing with multiple families of related objects.
- Requires a deep understanding of the domain in order to properly design the abstract factory and its associated products.
